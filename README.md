This machine learning project aims to classify job seeker ads as either innocent or malicious using a range of advanced tools, including:
Decision Trees: By leveraging decision tree algorithms, the project analyzes various features within the ads to make accurate classifications.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Employing ANN, the project enhances its ability to detect patterns and relationships in the ad content, enabling more precise categorization.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): By utilizing SVM algorithms, the project can effectively separate different types of job seeker ads, distinguishing between innocent ones and those with malicious intent.
K-means for Unsupervised Learning: Applying K-means clustering techniques, the project explores the data without predefined labels, uncovering hidden structures within the ads and aiding in the identification of potentially harmful content.
By leveraging these advanced tools, this project strives to create a robust and accurate system for classifying job seeker ads, facilitating a safer and more reliable experience for users.
